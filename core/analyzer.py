"""
core/analyzer.py — Rules engine that turns raw lag data into human-readable explanations.

Rule priority (first match wins):
  1. Single process >60% CPU          → CPU_SPIKE
  2. RAM >90% + swap active           → RAM_EXHAUSTION
  3. Many small processes (cluster)   → BACKGROUND_CLUSTER
  4. Responsiveness delay, CPU normal → DISK_IO (disk I/O bottleneck)
  5. Fallback                         → SCHEDULER_CONTENTION

Each rule returns a (cause_code, explanation) tuple.
Adding new rules is easy — just add a method prefixed with _rule_ and
register it in RULE_PRIORITY.  The engine tries them in order.
