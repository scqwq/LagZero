"""
core/recorder.py — Snapshot recorder.

Maintains a rolling buffer of recent SystemSamples so that when a lag event
fires, we can look BACKWARD (pre-lag context) as well as capture the peak.

This is the key differentiator from Task Manager — we capture what led up
to the lag, not just what's happening at the moment of pain.
